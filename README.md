## Hi, I'm Ira!

🔭 I’m currently working as a Software Engineering Intern at First American. My role is focused on replacing fuzzy string matching with a more intuitive LLM based verification system for home owner deeds. Additionally, as a CS student at the University of California, Irvine and a fellow at Cornell's Break Through Tech AI Program, I am consistently deep diving into the field of machine learning and intelligent systems. Follow along my journey as I program and experiement more and feel free to contact me!

🚩 My First Project - Airbnb Dataset Model Predicting Price Per Night
- I used the airbnb dataset for homes in New York and followed the model development process along with some EDA and exploratory data analysis.
